# Modules

These are modular plug ins which expand NexBot's functions whilst keeping the core code as simple as possible.
There is an example module which is a good place to start if you want to write your own. 

When creating a module please make sure to include a README.md which explains what it does. Try and keep to the same format as detailed below.

> # Module Name
> Description and examples
> # Usage
> Commands used if any.

Once you have written your module, it would be awesome if you could write some tests for it.
